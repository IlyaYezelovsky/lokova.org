# Joint Declaration of Lokova

## This is Lokova, a City of Generation Z.
We were born online, grew up connected, and live in constant updates.
Change is not something we wait for or adapt to — it is our default state.
Today, we, the residents of Lokova, speak for ourselves and declare:

### Freedom Above All, Individuality Blossoms
In Lokova, everyone is an independent and unique individual.
How you think, learn, create, and live is a matter of your own choices — laptop or tablet, Linux or Windows, dark or light mode...
Here, thought is not restricted, paths are not fixed, and curiosity is never questioned.
Freedom is the foundation of everything we build. 

### Diversity as Reality, Respect as Baseline 
We come from different parts of the world, speaking different languages, carrying different cultures.
Differences are real, and so is disagreement — but respect is our baseline.
Whether rivals in a game or partners in life, we reject hatred and prejudice, and choose understanding over division.

### Iteration Over Tradition
We do not cling to old answers simply because they exist.
There are no standard paths and no final solutions.
In science, technology, arts, sports, and life itself, we explore, experiment, try and catch.
Progress comes from those who dare to challenge what already exists.

### Equality by Design 
In Lokova, gender, identity, and background do not define the value of a person.
Everyone has equal rights to expression, competition, and growth.
We oppose discrimination, reject stereotypes, and work toward a society where fairness is built into the system, making Lokova a home for all.

### Gaming Spirit, Applied to Reality 
Gaming is more than entertainment — it is how we understand systems.
We construct and deconstruct rules, solve problems, cooperate, compete fairly, and improve what does not work and what works incorrectly.
In Lokova, we apply this mindset to reality: if the system is broken, we fix it; if the system is not good enough, we mod it.

## We are Generation Z, We are Lokova!
We are not waiting to be defined — we are defining the future together. Let’s build a world that truly belongs to us with an open heart, free thought, and creative passion!
