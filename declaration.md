# Joint Declaration of Lokova

### This is Lokova, a City of Generation Z.
We were born in the digital age, raised in a world of globalization, witnessing change and embracing innovation. Today, we, the residents of Lokova, declare together -

### Freedom Above All, Individuality Blossoms
In Lokova, everyone is an independent and unique being. Whether your identity, background, gender, culture, or whether you prefer Windows or Linux, we respect and support your choices. There are no shackles to restrict thought here - only a world of freedom to explore.

### Inclusivity and Respect
We come from different corners of the world, speaking different languages, with different customs and cultures. But in this city, we understand and respect each other. Whether a rival in a game or a buddy in real life, we believe kindness is superior to conflict, and cooperation trumps prejudice.

### Innovation and Challenge
We refuse to stick to old ways, daring to break boundaries, think, and create. Whether it's science, arts, music, sports or new life paths, we are exploring the endless possibilities of the future. There are no standard answers in the world, and we are ready to write our own version through action.

### Equality and Coexistence, Rejecting Prejudice
Here, gender, identity, and background are not the standards to define a person. Everyone has the right to express, compete, and grow equally. We reject stereotypes, oppose discrimination, and advocate for true equality, making Lokova a home for all.

### Gaming Spirit, Progress in Reality
Gaming is not just entertainment - it's a mindset, a problem-solving ability, and a creative power beyond reality. In Lokova, we face reality with this spirit, making the rules fairer and the world more fun.

### We are Generation Z, We are Lokova!
In this city, we are not defined; we define the future together. Let's build a world that truly belongs to us with an open heart, free thought, and creative passion!
