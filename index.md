> 世界是一座巨大的垃圾场。而我们每个人的生活，不过是在垃圾场中寻找有回收利用价值的物品。
> 
> 有人在垃圾场中失去生的希望，尸体与垃圾融为一体；有人却能用找到的电子元件，搭建起一台像模像样、性能不输品牌机的服务器。
> 
> 那我们就用这些回收到的东西，堆砌成一座城市！
> 
> The world is a giant garbage dump, and each of our lives is nothing more than searching for items worth recycling in it.
> 
> Some people lose hope of life in the garbage dump, and their bodies merge with the garbage; but some people can use the electronic components they find to build a decent server with performance that is no less than that of branded machines.
> 
> Then, we use these recycled things，to build a city!
